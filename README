  new
    Create a new WWW::Liquidweb::Lite object

   USAGE
    This module builds the necessary tools to interact with the Liquidweb
    API from a JSON file that is usually located at the following address:

            https://www.stormondemand.com/api/docs/v1/docs.json

    This is built up in a way that slightly resembles WSDL, but the JSON
    structure is Liquidweb specific.

    Example: my $liquidweb = WWW::Liquidweb::Lite->new(username =>
    'USERNAME', password => 'PASSWORD');

  help
    Get help with the Liquidweb API

   USAGE
    Calling the method 'help' at the end of your method API calls will
    return a hash of helpful information:

            my $server_list_help = $liquidweb->server->list->help;

    In this example, $server_list_help will contain information about the
    'Server/list' method in the Liquidweb API.

            $server_list_help->{__input}            This will contain a hash describing valid input parameters for this
                                                    method.

            $server_list_help->{__description}      This will contain a string that will describe aspects of the method,
                                                    and occasionally examples, insights, or other helpful information.

            $server_list_help->{__output}           This will contain a hash describing valid output that you may receive
                                                    back from the API call.

NAME
    WWW::Liquidweb::Lite - A module to interface with the Liquidweb API

SYNOPSIS
    You can create an object in this manner:

            my $liquidweb = WWW::Liquidweb::Lite->new(username => "USERNAME", password => "PASSWORD");

    USERNAME and PASSWORD correspond with the login credentials you would
    use for the Liquidweb API, as detailed here:

            http://www.liquidweb.com/StormServers/api/index.html

    Once you have the object you can call a method from the api in "object
    fashion". For example:

            'Storm/Server/list'

    Can be called from the object in this manner:

            $liquidweb->server->list

    The casing does not have to be correct.

    Arguments can be sent to the method as well:

            $liquidweb->server->list(category => 'Dedicated');
